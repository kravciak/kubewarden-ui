# Kubewarden UIx

This is an extension for [Rancher Manager](https://github.com/rancher/rancher) (`v2.7.0`) which allows you to interact with Kubewarden.

View the [Rancher UI Extension documentation](https://docs.kubewarden.io/operator-manual/ui-extension/install) for more in-depth info on how to use the UI. Visit the [Kubewarden docs](https://docs.kubewarden.io) for more insight on how to use Kubewarden.

## Install

You will need to point the UI to a running instance of Rancher, here's a [quickstart guide](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker) for setting up Rancher in a Docker container.

> This extension requires a Rancher version of `v2.7.0` or later, you can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases).

1. Navigate to the Extensions page from the side-nav and Enable the Extension support.
2. Once the Extension Operator has been installed you should see Kubewarden as an availble extension, click Install.

You will now have the Kubewarden Extension installed on your cluster.

3. Navigate to the Dashboard page by selecting the Kubewarden resource item and follow the steps to install the `Kubewarden` chart.

yarn install
```

2. Run the dashboard locally.

```sh
API=https://<rancher-host> yarn dev
```

### To test the build

```

3. In another terminal, serve the package.
